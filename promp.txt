Hello there! Right below I attached an article in Polish. Unfortunately some of the special polish letters are gone. Can you rewrite the article and correct it? Also the text is going to be used as <body></body> part of my .html file (so please don't add <body> </body> tags). Can you please add <img> tag after each paragraph? The <img> tag should point to "image_placeholder.jpg". I do also need creative prompts for generating the images. that will match topic of each paragaph in article. The prompts should be used as "alt" attribute in <img> tag. Can you also add the prompt as a caption under each image? That would be great, thank you very much <3
