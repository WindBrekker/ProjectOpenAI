# ProjectOpenAI
## Description
This program generates a fully formatted HTML section by combining a user-provided article and prompt with OpenAI's API capabilities. Using the pre-designed szablon.html template, users can seamlessly integrate the generated output to create a ready-to-use website.

## Installation
No additional installation is required. Users must provide their own OpenAI API key and store it in a .env file. The program will automatically access this key to generate content using the OpenAI library. The default prompt is fully customizable, allowing users to tailor the output to their specific needs.

## Usage
Add your OpenAI API key to a .env file.
Optionally, edit the prompt and article input for a customized result.
Run main.py. The program will generate an artykul.html file as output.
To create a fully functional webpage, paste the contents of artykul.html into the szablon.html template and view it in your browser.
